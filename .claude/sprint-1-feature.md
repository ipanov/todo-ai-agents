# Sprint 1: Add Task Priority Feature

## Feature Description
Add priority levels to tasks in the Todo application, allowing users to mark tasks as High, Medium, or Low priority and filter/sort by priority.

## Business Value
Users need to prioritize their tasks to focus on what's most important. This feature will help users organize their work more effectively.

### Story 4: Integration Tests (QA)
**As a** QA engineer
**I want to** verify priority functionality works end-to-end
**So that** users have a reliable feature

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Integration test: Create task with priority via API
- Integration test: Update task priority via API
- Integration test: Filter tasks by priority via API
- Integration test: Default priority is Medium
- E2E test with Playwright: User can set priority on new task
- E2E test with Playwright: User can filter tasks by priority
- E2E test with Playwright: Priority badges display correct colors

**Assigned to:** QA Agent

### Story 5: Build & Deployment Updates (DevOps)
**As a** DevOps engineer
**I want to** ensure the build handles database migrations
**So that** deployment is smooth

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- CI/CD pipeline runs database migrations
- Build succeeds with new schema
- No breaking changes in deployment process
- Update documentation if needed

**Assigned to:** DevOps Agent

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
```csharp
public enum TaskPriority
{
    High = 1,
    Medium = 2,
    Low = 3
}

public class TodoTask
{
    // Existing fields...
    public TaskPriority Priority { get; set; } = TaskPriority.Medium;
}
```

### API Changes
```
POST /api/tasks
{
    "title": "Task title",
    "priority": 1  // 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low
}

GET /api/tasks?priority=1  // Optional filter
```

### Redux State
```javascript
{
    tasks: [
        { id: 1, title: "Task", priority: "High" },
        // ...
    ],
    filters: {
        priority: "All" // or "High", "Medium", "Low"
    }
}
```
