## What We DON'T Know (Need to Find Out)

### Installation & Setup
❓ **How to install TechDebtGPT?**
- Is it a GitHub App that needs to be installed from marketplace?
- Is it a SaaS platform that connects to GitHub via OAuth?
- Does it require agent installation in the repository?
- Is there a free trial available?

❓ **Authentication**
- What permissions does it need?
- How does it access repository data?
- Does it need read access to code, commits, PRs?

### Integration Points

❓ **GitHub Integration**
- Does it use GitHub Apps API?
- Does it use GitHub webhooks?
- Does it require a `.techdebtgpt` config file in repo?
- Can it track contributors by email address?

❓ **Data Collection**
- Does it analyze commits in real-time or batch?
- How does it identify developers (GitHub username, email, both)?
- Does it track commits, PRs, issues, or all three?
- How far back in history does it analyze?

❓ **Atlassian/Jira Integration**
- Does it integrate with Jira for issue tracking?
- Can it correlate commits with Jira tickets?
- Is there a Confluence integration for documentation?

### Developer Rating System

❓ **Metrics Used**
Based on similar tools (SonarQube, Code Climate), TechDebtGPT likely uses:
- **Code Quality Metrics**
  - Code complexity (cyclomatic complexity)
  - Code duplication
  - Code smells
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Test coverage

- **Contribution Metrics**
  - Commit frequency
  - Lines of code changed
  - PR merge rate
  - PR review participation
  - Bug introduction rate
  - Bug fix rate

- **Collaboration Metrics**
  - Code review quality
  - Response time on PRs
  - Team collaboration score

❓ **Scoring Algorithm**
- What is the rating scale? (0-100, A-F, 1-5 stars?)
- How are metrics weighted?
- Is there a baseline or does it compare team members?
- Can we see individual metric breakdowns?

❓ **Agent Detection**
For our AI agents:
- Will TechDebtGPT recognize agents by email pattern (`*-agent-bot@todo-ai-agents.demo`)?
- Does it treat all Git committers as "developers"?
- Can we see per-agent metrics in the dashboard?

## Access & Trial Setup

### Steps to Get Started

1. **Visit TechDebtGPT Website**
   - Go to: https://www.techdebtgpt.com
   - Look for "Get Started", "Sign Up", or "Free Trial" button
   - Check if there's a docs/documentation section

2. **Sign Up Process**
   - Likely requires company email
   - May need to connect GitHub account
   - Probably uses OAuth for GitHub access

3. **Repository Connection**
   - Install GitHub App OR authorize OAuth access
   - Select which repositories to track
   - Configure any initial settings

4. **Dashboard Access**
   - Platform likely available at app.techdebtgpt.com
   - View team leaderboards
   - See individual developer metrics

## For Our AI Agent Demo

### What We Need TechDebtGPT to Do

1. **Detect All 5 AI Agents**
   - pm-agent-bot@todo-ai-agents.demo
   - backend-agent-bot@todo-ai-agents.demo
   - frontend-agent-bot@todo-ai-agents.demo
   - devops-agent-bot@todo-ai-agents.demo
   - qa-agent-bot@todo-ai-agents.demo

2. **Track Agent Commits**
   - Each agent's code contributions
   - Quality of commits by agent
   - Frequency and patterns

3. **Generate Metrics Per Agent**
   - Code quality score
   - Bug introduction rate
   - Commit patterns
   - Overall performance rating

4. **Identify Lowest Performing Agent**
   - Our meta-agent (techdebtgpt-agent-health-mvp) needs to:
     - Query TechDebtGPT for agent metrics
     - Identify the lowest-scoring agent
     - Generate improvement suggestions
     - Edit that agent's prompt to improve performance

### Expected Flow

```
Sprint 1: Feature Implementation
├─ PM Agent creates issues
├─ Backend Agent implements (makes commits)
├─ Frontend Agent implements (makes commits)
├─ DevOps Agent updates CI/CD (makes commits)
├─ QA Agent writes tests (makes commits)
└─ TechDebtGPT analyzes all commits

↓

TechDebtGPT Dashboard Shows:
├─ PM Agent: 85/100
├─ Backend Agent: 78/100
├─ Frontend Agent: 82/100
├─ DevOps Agent: 45/100 ⚠️ LOWEST
└─ QA Agent: 88/100

↓

Meta-Agent Detects:
"DevOps Agent scored 45/100 - needs optimization"

↓

Meta-Agent Actions:
1. Analyzes DevOps Agent's commits in TechDebtGPT
2. Identifies issues (e.g., poor documentation, complex code)
3. Edits .claude/agents/devops-agent.md with improvements
4. Creates improvement tasks for DevOps Agent

↓

Sprint 2: With Improved DevOps Agent
└─ Verify DevOps Agent performance improved
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. ✅ **Access TechDebtGPT Platform**
   - Visit website and sign up
   - Request trial access if needed
   - Contact Ritech if platform is not publicly available yet

2. ⏳ **Understand Integration**
   - Find documentation
   - Understand GitHub connection process
   - Identify API endpoints (if available)

3. ⏳ **Install on Repository**
   - Connect todo-ai-agents repository
   - Verify it detects agents from commit history
   - Confirm dashboard shows all 5 agents

4. ⏳ **Understand API Access**
   - Check if there's an API to query metrics
   - Understand authentication for API
   - Test retrieving agent scores programmatically

5. ⏳ **Build Meta-Agent Integration**
   - Create techdebtgpt-agent-health-mvp repository
   - Implement TechDebtGPT API integration (or web scraping if no API)
   - Build agent improvement logic

## Alternative Approaches (If TechDebtGPT Not Available)

If we can't access TechDebtGPT for the demo, we can:

### Plan B: Simulate TechDebtGPT Metrics
- Use GitHub API to analyze commits ourselves
- Calculate basic metrics (commit size, frequency, patterns)
- Create mock dashboard showing agent scores
- Still build the meta-agent optimization logic

### Plan C: Use Similar Tools
Alternative technical debt tools:
- **SonarQube** (open source, can self-host)
- **Code Climate** (has free tier)
- **CodeScene** (behavioral code analysis)

These could serve as a substitute for demo purposes.
